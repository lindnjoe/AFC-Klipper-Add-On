# Bambu AMS <-> Spoolman integration.
#
# The Bambu AMS reads its own tags -- unlike the ViViD/OpenAMS/ACE2 readers
# there is no host-side MFRC522 here, so the tag arrives as filament identity
# inside the unit's normal slot status. AFC_BambuAMS therefore keeps scanning
# and tag application; what lives HERE is everything downstream of that: the
# Spoolman lookup/bind/sync, UID binding memos, and the physical remaining
# weight the AMS measures by radius.
#
# Enable it with an [AFC_BambuAMS_rfid] section. Without one, AFC_BambuAMS
# runs exactly as before minus Spoolman -- every Spoolman entry point it calls
# is a shim on the unit that no-ops when this object is absent, so the core
# module never needs AFC_RFID's Spoolman half to be importable.
#
# The MEASUREMENT is not Spoolman work, though it lives in this class: turning
# a measured percent into the slot's remain_pct, the lane's grams and the saved
# vars. A unit with no Spoolman delegate gets a BambuSpoolman built with
# Spoolman off (see measurement_only) for exactly that half, so a capscan still
# lands with no section, with `enabled: False`, or with AFC_RFID missing.

        summary that was waiting on it.

        Called once AFC has put the spool on the lane or given up (its
        set_spoolID fetches the spool from Spoolman first and fires on_done
        when that answers), so the lane itself says what the answer was:

        * the bay no longer holds the tag: the reel left while Spoolman
          answered, the removal edge cleared and unbound the lane, and the
          answer bound it again. A link to a spool that is not in the bay is
          stale by definition, so the lane is cleared and unbound as that edge
          left it -- and put back on lane defaults when a reel nothing has
          read went in meanwhile (afcBambuAMS._defaults_until_read);
        * the lane is bound: the tag it was bound by is remembered;
        * the lane is not bound: no spool took the bind, so a measurement
          held for it is released (a spool linked later by hand is the
          operator's choice, see _settle_bind_owed). ``miss`` also records
          the UID as unknown to Spoolman, for the create path, whose helper
          does not say why nothing was bound.

        Never raises: it runs in a reactor callback.

        Two things can be left over from that one application, and each is
        finished here exactly once:

        * The bind that had not landed (``_bind_owed``). A fresh insert is
          measured before its Spoolman lookup answers, and the bind then
          hydrates the lane with whatever Spoolman had stored. The spool it
          attaches is owed the measurement. See _settle_bind_owed.
        * The material that had not been named (``_convert_owed``). A percent
          landing while the bay's record is still blank has no density to be
          weighed at, so it is written as tag-linear grams. See
          _settle_convert_owed.

        Anything that means the follow-up is no longer the same spool's -- the
        spool feeding the toolhead, the bay emptied or rescanned, a release --
        drops it; nothing here ever writes the measurement a second time.

        The lowest remain% this reel has measured, which is the honest one.

        The AMS derives its percent from a circumference measured over two
        spool revolutions, and repeat readings of an untouched reel spread by
        about +/-3%. Left alone, that noise moves the inventory figure up and
        down at every reseat.

        So use the one thing known for certain about a reel: what is on it
        never increases while it stays the same reel. A reading above this
        reel's previous one is noise, because the alternative is filament
        appearing; a reading below it is either consumption or noise, and
        taking it is the conservative direction. The stored figure therefore
        only ever comes down, and it settles near the bottom of the noise

        percent, which is the side to be wrong on when the question is
