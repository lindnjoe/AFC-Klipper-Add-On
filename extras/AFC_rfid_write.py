# Writing blank NTAG stickers, for every unit that has a host-side reader.
#
# The reader stack is transport-agnostic, so any reader with a reg_read/reg_write
# link can program a tag. Each RFID unit registers its readers here at ready and
# this module owns the commands:
#
#   AFC_RFID_READERS                list what is available and which are online
#   AFC_RFID_WRITE READER=<name>    write a tag on one of them
#
# There is no config section. The registry lives on the printer object, and the
# first unit to register also registers the commands.
#
# NTAG only: Bambu and Snapmaker tags are MIFARE Classic behind per-tag derived
# keys and are refused by name.
