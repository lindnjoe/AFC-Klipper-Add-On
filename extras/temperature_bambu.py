# Bambu AMS temperature and humidity sensor

# temperature sensor, so Mainsail/Fluidd show them on the temperature card the

    Neither value comes from a sensor we talk to directly -- both are read out
    of the unit's own reporting, which is why this has no bus configuration:

    * humidity -- %RH from offset 8 of the AMS's motion-long reply, refreshed
      by the bridge on a slow round-robin poll.
    * temperature -- the drying chamber, which is NOT in the binary protocol
      (the firmware's temp_c10 is a hardcoded -1). It arrives only as text in
      the AMS's own "[AMS_CHMB]s:...|vt:NN.N" telemetry.

    A unit with no dryer therefore reports humidity but no temperature, and
    that is normal rather than a fault -- see _sample for how that is handled
