    A pyserial-shaped TCP transport, for a bridge reached over the network.

    Opt-in. USB-CDC is the primary transport; this exists for a
    WiFi-capable Pico (or a socat/ser2net relay in front of a USB one) and is
    selected only by writing ``serial_port: tcp://host:port``. Nothing changes
    for a serial_port that is a device path.

    The bridge asks a port for exactly three things (``read(n)``,
    ``write(b)`` and ``close()``), so that is the whole surface here, with
    pyserial's semantics preserved because the reader and writer threads rely
    on them:

    - ``read`` returns b"" on timeout (a quiet link is not an error) and
      raises at end of stream, which is what makes the reader drop the port
      and reconnect with backoff. Returning b"" there instead would spin.
    - ``write`` raises ``_SerialTimeout`` when it cannot get the bytes out in
      time, so a busy far end lands in the writer's "bridge busy, write of
      ... timed out" path, as a Pico that stopped draining its CDC does,
      rather than killing the link.

    The socket timeout is never changed after connect. The reader thread sits
    in recv while the writer thread sends, so a settimeout() around a write
    would change the timeout out from under a blocked read. The write deadline is enforced by
    looping on a short fixed timeout instead. recv and send from two threads
    on one socket is otherwise fine: the directions are independent.
