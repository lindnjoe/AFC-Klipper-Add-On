# AFC Unit Heaters, one web panel for every filament dryer on the printer
#
# Bambu AMS 2 Pro / AMS HT and Anycubic ACE units all have drying heaters, and
# all of them are otherwise driven by typed G-code with different names, units
# and argument spellings (AFC_BAMBU_HEATER_START ... TIME=minutes vs
# ACE_DRY ... DURATION=minutes). This serves a single control panel for all of
# them, discovered from the printer config at startup: whatever dryers exist in
# AFC.cfg appear here, drawn to match their hardware.
#
# Configuration:
#
#   [afc_dryer]
#   port: 8093              # HTTP port to serve on
#   bind: 0.0.0.0           # 127.0.0.1 to restrict to the host
#   poll: 2.0               # seconds between status snapshots
#   show_heaterless: False  # also list EVERY other AFC unit -- BoxTurtle,
#                           # HTLF, OpenAMS and so on -- read-only, so the
#                           # panel can show the whole machine at once
#
# Then add it to Mainsail/Fluidd as a webcam with service type "iframe" and
# URL http://<printer-host>:8093/, an iframe camera is the only way to get an
# interactive panel into either UI, neither having a plugin API. It is also
# just a web page, so that URL works on its own in any browser.
#
# Adding a vendor
# ---------------
# Subclass _Backend, fill in the six hooks, and add it to _BACKENDS. Nothing
# else in the module knows what an AMS or an ACE is -- the page renders from
# the descriptor each backend returns.
#
# Threading
# ---------
# The HTTP server runs on its own thread and Klipper's reactor is emphatically
# not thread-safe, so this module never touches printer objects from a request:
#
#   * status is snapshotted by a reactor timer into a plain dict under a lock,
#     and requests only ever read that dict;
#   * commands are handed back to the reactor with register_async_callback and
#     run there, never inline in the handler.
#
# Reading a unit's get_status() from the HTTP thread would mostly appear to
# work, which is exactly what makes it a bad idea.

    Temperature and humidity for a unit that keeps them on a SEPARATE sensor.

    A Bambu unit reports its own chamber telemetry, so its backend just reads
    it. An OpenAMS does not: its HDC1080/AHT is an ordinary Klipper sensor
    section, and the humidity only reaches the printer objects through the
    sensor driver's own object -- `temperature_sensor oams1` carries
    temperature alone, while `aht10 oams1` carries both. That is why the panel
    showed nothing for a unit whose readings were sitting right there.

    Nor can the object be found by the unit's name: the AFC unit here is
    `ams_1` while its sensor is `oams1`, named after the [AFC_OAMS] controller,
    and an ACE owner may have called the section anything at all -- `ace_temp`
    beside a unit named `Ace_1`. So candidates are tried in order of how
    specific they are: the name the unit declares in `environment_sensor`, then
    its controller, then its own name.

    MATCHED BY NAME, NOT BY SENSOR TYPE. This used to build object names from
    a list of driver prefixes, which failed twice on one real machine: the
    driver was `aht3x`, which was not on the list, and the section was
    `oams1` while the unit declared `oams = OAMS1`, so even the
    temperature_sensor wrapper missed on case alone. Nothing here needs to
    know which chip it is -- an object whose name matches and which reports a
    temperature or a humidity IS the sensor. A humidity-carrying match wins,
    because the driver object has both while the temperature_sensor wrapper
    over the same chip has only temperature.
