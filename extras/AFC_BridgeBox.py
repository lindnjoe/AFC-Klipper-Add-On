#
# A hand-written BambuAMS setup is three boilerplate sections per unit
# ([AFC_BambuAMS <name>], an [AFC_lane] per slot, an [AFC_hub]); this module
# fabricates them from the roster and the chain's extruder/buffer, the way
# AFC_utils.add_filament_switch does, so other modules cannot tell them from
# printer.cfg text.
#
#   [AFC_BridgeBox chain1]
#   serial_port: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Raspberry_Pi_Pico_XXXX-if00
#   extruder: extruder
#   buffer: Bamb_1
#   lane_base: 24
#   roster: ht:0123456789ABCDEF00003331
#
# The roster comes from config plus a persisted roster file, since sections
# must exist before the port is usable; pooled spares (pool_ams / pool_ht)
# cover units that appear live. An entry is `<model>:<unit_uid>`; a boxed unit
# of unknown generation enrolls as `boxed` and is refined later without its
# lanes moving.
#
# Names are pinned per uid and a unit's lanes follow its name's rank, so
# removing a unit never renumbers the survivors (lane names carry Spoolman
# bindings and T# macros) and a returning unit gets its lanes back. Learned
# values (bowden lengths) are saved per uid, not per bay.

        The deliberate half of removal: erase a unit's tombstones.

        Unplugging erases nothing: with a pool the unit stays in the roster and its
        bay waits for it, and without one auto-removal (see _prune_missing) only
        edits the roster, leaving the unit's lane numbers, unit name, and learned
        values recorded for its return. For a unit that is not coming back, this
        command releases them: the uid leaves the recorded roster and the lane and
        name maps, its learned record (see _learned_section) is erased, and so is
        every section stored under its name and lanes (from the state block and
        auto_vars), so the freed name and lanes are safe for the next new unit to
        reuse. A uid with only a learned record left can be forgotten too, and so
        can one that holds a pool bay, or is a bay's last owner, without being
        recorded (claimed onto a spare and pulled within enroll_grace). Its
        bay_owner entry and the lane records kept for it (see _held_for) go too,
        and AFC.var.unit is saved without them, so a re-plug starts from clean
        lanes, and so does what the chain watch tracks for it this session (see
        _drop_watch_state).

        Works on a live unit too: it drops the unit's lanes/T# immediately and
        parks the uid on a suppress list (see _forget_suppressed) so the scout does
        not re-enroll the hardware still on the wire; the hold clears when the unit
        is physically pulled, so a genuine re-plug enrolls it fresh. Forgetting a
        unit claimed onto a bay mid-print is refused, since it would pull a live
        lane out from under the job. So is forgetting a unit while AFC records a
        lane of its bay as loaded to a toolhead, claimed or not, and forgetting a
        unit whose bay is unclaimed before PREP has restored that record. FORCE=1
        overrides the mid-print, PREP and loaded-lane refusals, clearing the
        loaded-lane record first. The loaded-lane refusal comes before the print
        one, so it names the lane FORCE=1 clears. With neither UID nor NAME, pops a
        picker listing every recorded unit, each with its own Forget button.

        bay at restart. The uid's learned values go with it (see _apply_learned).
        UID alone pops the bay picker for a unit on a bay. A unit that found no
        free bay of its family is told so instead, and pointed at
        AFC_BRIDGEBOX_REPLACE while a bay of its family is held for a unit that is

        Unlink a UID from its pool bay: the reverse of ASSIGN.

        Drops the name/lane pin so the unit reverts to a floating spare (it
        re-claims onto a free bay of its family, the one it was last claimed onto
        first, and is saved there once online for enroll_grace; see _drop_pin).
        Learned values, saved lane records and roster enrolment are kept, since this
        is not FORGET: learned values apply on whatever bay it claims next, and the
        lane records if that is its last bay. A unit unassigned live with FORCE=1
        has usually been online that long already, so it is re-homed and saved on
        the next watch tick; ASSIGN is the way to choose its bay. A uid a set
        roster: option does not list is never saved (see _pin_recorded_units): it
        floats for the session, and the reply says to add it to roster:. Refuses a
        unit that is online now unless FORCE=1 (which drops its lanes live first),
        and likewise a unit whose bay has a lane AFC records as loaded to a
        toolhead, claimed or not, or whose bay is unclaimed before PREP has
        restored that record (FORCE=1 clears the record first). The loaded-lane

        Pop the bay manager, listing every pool bay with its occupant.

        Each occupied bay gets an Unassign button (FORCE=1, live), up to
        _MAX_BAY_BUTTONS. This is the manual entry point to the same unassign the
        plug/unplug popups lead to, callable any time.

        The Unassign button sends FORCE=1 so a live unit can be unlinked, and
        FORCE=1 also clears a lane AFC records as loaded to a toolhead, claimed or
        not, and skips the PREP wait for an unclaimed bay. So a bay with such a
        lane is listed with it and gets no button, and neither does an unclaimed
        bay before PREP has restored that record, nor, during a print, a bay a unit
        is claimed onto: unassigning it drops its lanes and T#s, which the print may
        be using. The typed command with FORCE=1 still releases each.

        A unit on the chain that found no free bay of its family is listed after
        the bays. While a bay of its family is held for a unit offline
        release_grace or longer (see _replace_candidates), it gets a Replace
        button, ahead of the Unassign buttons so the button cap never hides it,
        which opens the replace picker (see _prompt_replace_unit). A set roster:
        option decides which units get a bay, so it gets none then.

        Runs live: AFC_BRIDGEBOX_FORGET of the offline unit, then
        AFC_BRIDGEBOX_ASSIGN of the new one to the bay that frees. Each runs as its
        own handler (see _ChildCommand), so their refusals and console lines apply
        unchanged. The new unit takes the bay's name, lanes and T#, pinned so a
        restart keeps it there. FORGET erases what was saved for the old unit, so
        the new one gets none of its lane records, spools, T# maps or learned
        values.

        overrides none of these: a chain with no pool (nothing is claimed live
        there), a set roster: option (it decides which units get a bay), a new
        unit on a bay already (ASSIGN moves a unit between bays), a bay of the

        on, and an old unit that is online or whose online flag cannot be read
        (the bridge link is down, or has not reported the chain yet). Without
        FORCE=1 it also refuses during a print, before PREP has run (AFC's
        loaded-lane record is not restored yet, see _prep_settled), a bay with a
        lane AFC records as loaded to a toolhead, and a bay whose unit has not been
        offline release_grace on a live chain (see _track_absence). FORCE=1 clears
        that loaded-lane record.

        UID defaults to the one unit waiting for a bay. OLD takes the old unit's

        Close the loop between fabricated sections and AFC's learned values.

        ConfigRewrite files a learned key whose section is in no .cfg file
        into AFC_auto_vars.cfg under the section's name, and that file is
        klippy-parsed config. For a fabricated unit such a value would be
        invisible (its sections come from a private parser) and, once the
        fabricated name changed, klippy would instantiate a unit from the
        leftover at boot. This handles both:

        FOLD: a unit section takes the learned values of the uid it is
        built for: its record (see _learned_section), then the
        _LEARNED_KEYS of an auto_vars section under its name, newest last.
        Those go back into the uid's record. A spare is built for no uid, so
        it takes none, and any other key an auto_vars unit section carries is
        not folded; both are noted (see _learned_notes). Hub, lane and
        temperature sections take the store and auto_vars sections under
        their own names (structural keys excepted), so a value learned for a
        bay's lanes survives a restart there.

        SWEEP: folded auto_vars sections move into this module's own store
        file, which klippy never parses, and are deleted from auto_vars. An
        orphan, an AFC_BambuAMS section in auto_vars whose name nothing
        fabricates and which exists in no other config file (its key set in
        the merged fileconfig equals its key set in auto_vars alone), is
        deleted too: it is a leftover for a renamed unit, whose learned
        values travel under its uid. A lane, hub or temperature section this
        chain may have built at an earlier start (see _former_names) and no
        chain builds now is a leftover as well: it moves into the store
        under its own name, where the fold finds it if that name is built
        again. With several chains, only the last one in the config sweeps
        orphans and leftovers, past the names the others fabricate (see
        _sweep_orphans).

        File edits take effect next boot (this boot already parsed
        auto_vars). For the rest of this boot the fail-soft unit makes an
        orphan harmless, and a stand-in object keeps klippy from building a
        leftover (see _sweep_orphans).

        Move learned values stored under a bay name into the uid records.

        A state section [AFC_BambuAMS <name>] holds what the unit wearing
        that name learned. For a name this chain uses (a bay it fabricates,
        or a name its map records), the section goes to the uid that wore
        the name: the _LEARNED_KEYS its record lacks are copied (a length
        the record holds wins), anything that is not a length is dropped,
        and the section is removed.

        The wearer is the uid the name map records for the name before this
        boot drew names, so a uid that takes the name over at this boot
        never gets what an earlier holder learned. Only when no uid was
        recorded with the name is it the uid that draws it now: a unit the
        last session recorded but never saved. With roster: set, the values
        under a spare's name that no unit draws go to the one unit of its
        family that the recorded roster lists and roster: does not (see
        _unlisted_floaters), when that is the only such unit and this the
        only such spare with values: a build before bay_owner ran it on that
        spare. Both are guesses
        (the unit may have learned on another bay), and a wrong length
        corrects itself on the unit's next load, which re-adopts a
        measurement PATH_ADOPT_TOLERANCE_MM or more away.

        With several uids recorded for the name, the one holding the
        rostered bay of that name is the owner. If that does not settle it,
        the section is left in place and never read while one of them still
        holds the name, and removed once another unit has taken the name
        over. Any other name recorded for no uid is a spare's leftover, and
        its section is removed: folding it would hand those values to the
        next unit on the bay. Names this chain does not use are another chain's
        and are left alone. Writes once, only when something changed.

        Hold the lane records the last session saved for each pool bay.

        AFC.var.unit still has them at klippy:ready: AFC's save_vars writes
        nothing until PREP has run. A bay's records were written while a unit
        was claimed onto it, so they are held for the unit bay_owner names
        for that bay, and handed to it alone when it claims the bay (see
        _held_for). They are held for the session, so a unit that comes
        online late still gets them, and every save writes them back to the
        bay while no unit is claimed onto it (see _fill_held_bays), so a
        restart before that unit comes back holds them again.

        A state block with no bay_owner key at all has recorded no owner:
        it is from a build before bay_owner, which gave a bay's records to
        whichever unit claimed it. Then a bay reserved for a unit at this
        boot is that unit's, as only that unit can claim a reserved bay,
        when the unit's name was pinned to that bay before this boot, or
        when the unit held no name and no unit held the bay's (the same
        guess _migrate_name_learned makes). With roster: set, the records of
        an unreserved spare whose name no unit held go to the one unit of
        its family that the recorded roster lists and roster: does not (see
        _unlisted_floaters), when that is the only such unit and this the
        only such spare with records. Any other bay's records are left
        unattributed. Each guess is recorded as its bay's owner, so the unit
        takes that bay back (see _last_bay), and is written once PREP has
        run (see _persist_bay_owner), or before a pin changes (see
        _keep_guessed_owners): later starts read it, and do not guess again
        from pins that can change by then.

        The records of a bay whose lanes this start moved, saved under the
